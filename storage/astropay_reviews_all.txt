Money Stuck ‚Äì iCashOne (AstroPay India) Blocked My Account
was using iCashOne, the AstroPay app for India, and my account suddenly got blocked without any reason. I had money in my wallet, but since then there has been no response from their support team.

It‚Äôs shocking that a financial app can just lock users out and keep their funds without any explanation or resolution. I have tried multiple times to reach out, but there is zero customer support.

This experience has been very disappointing and unprofessional. If this is how AstroPay operates in India through iCashOne, I strongly advise others to be very cautious before trusting them with your money.

Hello Rudhra,

Thank you for your feedback and for letting us know about your iCash account.

While AstroPay is no longer available in India, iCash may serve as an alternative platform that offers similar features designed for local users in India.

For any questions or clarifications related to AstroPay, please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us again. We‚Äôll be glad to assist you further and point you in the right direction.

AstroPay keeps blocking my withdrawals with endless reviews
I received money to my AstroPay account on August 08 and since then they keep blocking me every time I try to withdraw. They put my account under ‚Äúreview‚Äù for 7 days, restore it, then block me again when I try to remove my money. This has happened over and over.

This feels like a scam ‚Äì AstroPay is holding my money hostage. Do NOT trust them!

Terrible Experience ‚Äì ‚Çπ1,30,000 Wallet Balance Stuck for Over a Month!
I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with AstroPay. My wallet balance of ‚Çπ1,30,000 has been stuck since June, and despite multiple emails and follow-ups (Ticket ID: 21744189), there has been no clear resolution.

They initially claimed my balance was used to clear a "pending debt" I was never informed about. Later, they said my case is "under analysis" with no timeline or response. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm under severe financial pressure, with EMIs due and bank officials repeatedly calling me.

AstroPay has shown no transparency, accountability, or urgency in resolving this serious issue. This experience has caused me emotional stress and financial hardship. I would strongly advise others to avoid using AstroPay Wallet.

Hello, Abhishek.

Thank you for your feedback and for letting us know about the system migration and the merchant integration.

We understand the situation regarding this migration and the process of accessing your balance.

For the withdrawal from the merchant account to the new application, we recommend reaching out to the merchant‚Äôs support team directly to request an alternative withdrawal method available for users in India.

Rest assured, the team is currently working on improving the wide-range option for the merchant integration with the new system.

Your satisfaction is important to us, and we are taking steps to improve this.

We appreciate your patience and are here to assist you further. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us if you have any more questions or concerns.

Withdrawal Marked ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù but Still‚Ä¶
Withdrawal Marked ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù but Still Not Processed ‚Äî No UTR, No Funds, Just Excuses

Review Body:

I initiated a ‚Çπ30,000 withdrawal from my verified AstroPay wallet on July 19, 2025. The app marked it as ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù, but the amount was never credited to my bank account.

After multiple support tickets, AstroPay has now admitted that the transaction is actually ‚Äúunder review‚Äù ‚Äî meaning it was never processed or sent to my bank despite showing ‚Äúcompleted.‚Äù

They are unable or unwilling to provide a UTR, which would be standard for any NEFT/IMPS payment in India. Their ‚Äúinternal policy‚Äù is simply an excuse to cover for backend delays or unresolved compliance issues.

This is extremely misleading for users and unacceptable for any platform handling financial transactions. I‚Äôve now waited several days with no refund, no credit, and no proof that the money ever left AstroPay‚Äôs system.

If you value transparency, accountability, or timely access to your money ‚Äî AstroPay is not a platform you can rely on. I am preparing to escalate this legally and via the Indian consumer forum if not resolved immediately.

Hello, Satya.

Thank you for sharing your experience with us regarding your withdrawal transaction.

We understand that sometimes withdrawal is shown as approved in the application, but the amount is not yet being credited to your bank account.

There are several factors that may affect your withdrawal not being received in your bank account, including the security checks between the provider and your bank account system to ensure the security of the transaction.

We were able to check your case with our team based on the details shared in your Trustpilot review. We want to assure you that our dedicated support team is actively working on resolving it, and we are giving your case the attention it deserves.

We understand the importance of timely communication, and we will make it a priority to get back to you promptly with an update. You can expect to hear from us via email as soon as possible.

Thank you for your patience, and we look forward to resolving this matter for you.

Best Regards,

Support on this app is a joke.

My account was suspended some years ago, because i wanted to. Recently i got an email stating about migration. Contacted support and wanted my email and info deleted. Support states i need to provide an id to remove my info and email.

I said theres no rules or laws saying i need to provide id to remove my email from the list.

They getting more stupid and stupid overtime repeated.

I recommend nobody to install and get into this app that has support like school kids in it. :)

Hello, Kristian.

Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

We‚Äôd like to confirm that your account was successfully suspended at your request on April 12, 2023, at 16:05:34 GMT, and has remained suspended since that date.

Regarding the email you received, this is to inform our users that their AstroPay accounts have been migrated to our authorized entity, Larstal Denmark. Specifically for our inactive users, they have to activate their accounts by completing the required information to finalize the migration process before September 1.

As your account has been suspended, you can ignore this email, and there's nothing to worry about.

Should you have more questions, feel free to contact our support agents at support@astropay.com, and we'll be happy to assist you.

Best regards,
AstroPay Support Team

I have 3 pending withdrawals of INR 2000, INR 1500 & INR 1685 that I had requested yesterday. There services used to be good but for the past one year or so they have started giving pathetic services, their customer services takes ages to respond, they have got a CHAT BOT which gives irrelevant canned responses. They deliberately hold on funds and you literally need to write them multiple emails and constantly beg for your own money. I'm really considering to change the payment aggregator now and switch to Skrill or Neteller.

Unfair Account Restriction with No Transparency.
Unfair Account Restriction with No Transparency.

I‚Äôm very disappointed with my experience using AstroPay. My account was permanently blocked without any clear reason or explanation. Despite reaching out multiple times and asking for clarification, I was met with the same generic responses stating that the decision was final, with no specific information on what I supposedly did wrong.
As someone who values transparency and follows platform rules, it‚Äôs frustrating to be treated this way. I was willing to cooperate fully if there were any misunderstandings, but the support team refused to review the case further or provide details.
AstroPay may work well for some, but in my experience, their customer support lacks fairness and transparency, especially when users are left in the dark with no chance to appeal or correct a situation.
I hope they reconsider how they handle such cases moving forward.

Rs 2600 Not Credited to AstroPay Account Despite Successful UPI Payment (UTR 513587619532).
Update: Though AstroPay customer care kept saying that the payment had failed and the amount would be refunded by my bank, my bank clearly informed me that the transaction was successful, and the money was successfully remitted to the merchant. On 27th May, Rs. 2600 was finally added to my AstroPay wallet. Honestly, AstroPay should have at least acknowledged that the payment was successful.

User ID - QaYPxV9A

I am extremely disappointed with the way my issue is being handled.

Made a deposit using UPI of Rs 2600 on May 15, 2025, 8:36 PM, Payment ID 439817342.

Payment Method: Google Pay (UPI)
Merchant Name: BLISSCART BAZAR
UPI ID: blisscart@idfcbank
Transaction Number (UTR) : 513587619532
Issue: Amount not credited to AstroPay account.

The payment was successfully processed and the amount was debited from my bank account. However, the funds have not been added in my AstroPay wallet.

After waiting for some time, I contacted AstroPay Support and shared the payment screenshot. I was advised to wait for 24 hours, after which appropriate assistance would be provided if the issue remained unresolved.

Following the advice, I contacted support again the next day (after more than 24 hours), shared all relevant screenshots again, and also uploaded the required details on the website. Despite these steps, i received no help.

I have contacted your support team multiple times and shared all relevant screenshots. However, instead of resolving the issue, I was told that the transaction failed in their system and that I would receive a refund. This is completely misleading as my bank is saying that Payment was successful and I will not get refund, I need to contact the merchant for refund.

The Merchant has received the money and is not crediting it to my AstroPay account. This raises serious concerns about the integrity of operations of Astropay, and from my point of view, this is starting to look like a scam.

kindly provide me refund or add the amount in my astropay wallet.

20-05-2025 - No Update yet no refund, Customer care is saying that the transaction was failed on their side, Bank is saying money is with the merchant and transaction was successful. Astropay told me to wait till 26th May 2025. Let's see.

Money Stuck ‚Äì iCashOne (AstroPay India) Blocked My Account
was using iCashOne, the AstroPay app for India, and my account suddenly got blocked without any reason. I had money in my wallet, but since then there has been no response from their support team.

It‚Äôs shocking that a financial app can just lock users out and keep their funds without any explanation or resolution. I have tried multiple times to reach out, but there is zero customer support.

This experience has been very disappointing and unprofessional. If this is how AstroPay operates in India through iCashOne, I strongly advise others to be very cautious before trusting them with your money.

AstroPay keeps blocking my withdrawals with endless reviews
I received money to my AstroPay account on August 08 and since then they keep blocking me every time I try to withdraw. They put my account under ‚Äúreview‚Äù for 7 days, restore it, then block me again when I try to remove my money. This has happened over and over.

This feels like a scam ‚Äì AstroPay is holding my money hostage. Do NOT trust them!

Terrible Experience ‚Äì ‚Çπ1,30,000 Wallet Balance Stuck for Over a Month!
I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with AstroPay. My wallet balance of ‚Çπ1,30,000 has been stuck since June, and despite multiple emails and follow-ups (Ticket ID: 21744189), there has been no clear resolution.

They initially claimed my balance was used to clear a "pending debt" I was never informed about. Later, they said my case is "under analysis" with no timeline or response. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm under severe financial pressure, with EMIs due and bank officials repeatedly calling me.

AstroPay has shown no transparency, accountability, or urgency in resolving this serious issue. This experience has caused me emotional stress and financial hardship. I would strongly advise others to avoid using AstroPay Wallet.

Hello, Abhishek.

Thank you for your feedback and for letting us know about the system migration and the merchant integration.

We understand the situation regarding this migration and the process of accessing your balance.

For the withdrawal from the merchant account to the new application, we recommend reaching out to the merchant‚Äôs support team directly to request an alternative withdrawal method available for users in India.

Rest assured, the team is currently working on improving the wide-range option for the merchant integration with the new system.

Your satisfaction is important to us, and we are taking steps to improve this.

We appreciate your patience and are here to assist you further. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us if you have any more questions or concerns.

Withdrawal Marked ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù but Still‚Ä¶
Withdrawal Marked ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù but Still Not Processed ‚Äî No UTR, No Funds, Just Excuses

Review Body:

I initiated a ‚Çπ30,000 withdrawal from my verified AstroPay wallet on July 19, 2025. The app marked it as ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù, but the amount was never credited to my bank account.

After multiple support tickets, AstroPay has now admitted that the transaction is actually ‚Äúunder review‚Äù ‚Äî meaning it was never processed or sent to my bank despite showing ‚Äúcompleted.‚Äù

They are unable or unwilling to provide a UTR, which would be standard for any NEFT/IMPS payment in India. Their ‚Äúinternal policy‚Äù is simply an excuse to cover for backend delays or unresolved compliance issues.

This is extremely misleading for users and unacceptable for any platform handling financial transactions. I‚Äôve now waited several days with no refund, no credit, and no proof that the money ever left AstroPay‚Äôs system.

If you value transparency, accountability, or timely access to your money ‚Äî AstroPay is not a platform you can rely on. I am preparing to escalate this legally and via the Indian consumer forum if not resolved immediately.

Hello, Satya.

Thank you for sharing your experience with us regarding your withdrawal transaction.

We understand that sometimes withdrawal is shown as approved in the application, but the amount is not yet being credited to your bank account.

There are several factors that may affect your withdrawal not being received in your bank account, including the security checks between the provider and your bank account system to ensure the security of the transaction.

We were able to check your case with our team based on the details shared in your Trustpilot review. We want to assure you that our dedicated support team is actively working on resolving it, and we are giving your case the attention it deserves.

We understand the importance of timely communication, and we will make it a priority to get back to you promptly with an update. You can expect to hear from us via email as soon as possible.

Thank you for your patience, and we look forward to resolving this matter for you.

Hello, Pavan.

Thank you for sharing your experience with us regarding your pending payment.

Please know that each payment varies based on the method selected, and approval times are estimated rather than instantaneous.

Some of the reasons your payment may not be automatically approved within the processing period are listed below:
- Payment instructions were not followed correctly.
- The amount paid was incorrect.
- The payment was made through a third-party account.
- The payment was made after the order had already expired.

We have sent you an email to further explain the situation and what the next step is. Please know that our dedicated support team is actively working on resolving your payment issues, and we will make it a priority.

Don't hesitate to reach out if you require further help or have additional inquiries. We're always ready to help you!

Support on this app is a joke.

My account was suspended some years ago, because i wanted to. Recently i got an email stating about migration. Contacted support and wanted my email and info deleted. Support states i need to provide an id to remove my info and email.

I said theres no rules or laws saying i need to provide id to remove my email from the list.

They getting more stupid and stupid overtime repeated.

I recommend nobody to install and get into this app that has support like school kids in it. :)

Hello, Kristian.

Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

We‚Äôd like to confirm that your account was successfully suspended at your request on April 12, 2023, at 16:05:34 GMT, and has remained suspended since that date.

Regarding the email you received, this is to inform our users that their AstroPay accounts have been migrated to our authorized entity, Larstal Denmark. Specifically for our inactive users, they have to activate their accounts by completing the required information to finalize the migration process before September 1.

As your account has been suspended, you can ignore this email, and there's nothing to worry about.

Should you have more questions, feel free to contact our support agents at support@astropay.com, and we'll be happy to assist you.

Best regards,
AstroPay Support Team

I have 3 pending withdrawals of INR 2000, INR 1500 & INR 1685 that I had requested yesterday. There services used to be good but for the past one year or so they have started giving pathetic services, their customer services takes ages to respond, they have got a CHAT BOT which gives irrelevant canned responses. They deliberately hold on funds and you literally need to write them multiple emails and constantly beg for your own money. I'm really considering to change the payment aggregator now and switch to Skrill or Neteller.

Unfair Account Restriction with No Transparency.
Unfair Account Restriction with No Transparency.

I‚Äôm very disappointed with my experience using AstroPay. My account was permanently blocked without any clear reason or explanation. Despite reaching out multiple times and asking for clarification, I was met with the same generic responses stating that the decision was final, with no specific information on what I supposedly did wrong.
As someone who values transparency and follows platform rules, it‚Äôs frustrating to be treated this way. I was willing to cooperate fully if there were any misunderstandings, but the support team refused to review the case further or provide details.
AstroPay may work well for some, but in my experience, their customer support lacks fairness and transparency, especially when users are left in the dark with no chance to appeal or correct a situation.
I hope they reconsider how they handle such cases moving forward.

Rs 2600 Not Credited to AstroPay Account Despite Successful UPI Payment (UTR 513587619532).
Update: Though AstroPay customer care kept saying that the payment had failed and the amount would be refunded by my bank, my bank clearly informed me that the transaction was successful, and the money was successfully remitted to the merchant. On 27th May, Rs. 2600 was finally added to my AstroPay wallet. Honestly, AstroPay should have at least acknowledged that the payment was successful.

User ID - QaYPxV9A

I am extremely disappointed with the way my issue is being handled.

Made a deposit using UPI of Rs 2600 on May 15, 2025, 8:36 PM, Payment ID 439817342.

Payment Method: Google Pay (UPI)
Merchant Name: BLISSCART BAZAR
UPI ID: blisscart@idfcbank
Transaction Number (UTR) : 513587619532
Issue: Amount not credited to AstroPay account.

The payment was successfully processed and the amount was debited from my bank account. However, the funds have not been added in my AstroPay wallet.

After waiting for some time, I contacted AstroPay Support and shared the payment screenshot. I was advised to wait for 24 hours, after which appropriate assistance would be provided if the issue remained unresolved.

Following the advice, I contacted support again the next day (after more than 24 hours), shared all relevant screenshots again, and also uploaded the required details on the website. Despite these steps, i received no help.

I have contacted your support team multiple times and shared all relevant screenshots. However, instead of resolving the issue, I was told that the transaction failed in their system and that I would receive a refund. This is completely misleading as my bank is saying that Payment was successful and I will not get refund, I need to contact the merchant for refund.

The Merchant has received the money and is not crediting it to my AstroPay account. This raises serious concerns about the integrity of operations of Astropay, and from my point of view, this is starting to look like a scam.

kindly provide me refund or add the amount in my astropay wallet.

20-05-2025 - No Update yet no refund, Customer care is saying that the transaction was failed on their side, Bank is saying money is with the merchant and transaction was successful. Astropay told me to wait till 26th May 2025. Let's see.

Scam App

Title: AstroPay Holding ‚Çπ3,900 ‚Äì No Refund, No Proper Response. Legal Action Next.

Review:

I made a ‚Çπ3,900 withdrawal from AstroPay on April 30, 2025. It's now been over a week, and I still haven't received the money.

Support falsely claimed the transaction was rejected and refunded ‚Äî but my wallet only shows ‚Çπ25. The transaction is stuck on ‚Äútaking longer than expected‚Äù and no refund has been credited.

I‚Äôve emailed them several times, but AstroPay is not replying properly. I‚Äôm tired of copy-paste responses and false promises.

My details:
User ID: RnEep3XA

If the refund is not processed immediately, I will:

File a complaint with the RBI Ombudsman and Consumer Forum India

Take legal action for financial loss and stress

Report this issue across social media, forums, and legal platforms

This is unacceptable behavior from a company handling financial transactions. I strongly advise others to stay away from AstroPay.

Absolutely terrible experience
Absolutely terrible experience. My account was permanently closed without any valid reason, even though I hadn‚Äôt made a single transaction or deposit. Their support team gave a generic response citing ‚Äúclause 11.3‚Äù without any real explanation. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt put any money into their system ‚Äî it‚Äôs clearly unreliable and untrustworthy. Avoid AstroPay at all costs.

Hello ≈Åukasz,

Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us.

Please know that we take such actions only when necessary, often due to violations of our Customer Agreement, Terms of Service, or applicable financial regulations. These actions are guided by our policies, specifically mentioned in Clause 11.3 of our Terms and Conditions, to ensure the security of our platform.

Unfortunately, due to regulatory requirements, we are unable to provide specific details about the reason for the deactivation. Our top priority is to protect the safety and integrity of our users' accounts and funds. While we aim to minimize disruptions, there are times when account deactivation is unavoidable.

not been a good experience
This app/company has not been a good experience. the physical card never worked from the start, so i gave up on it in frustration. Tried contacting their technical support so lost interest in the whole thing. There's still money on my card (I think) and when I tried to access the app today I got an almost aggressive message telling me my account had been closed. No explanation and no way of getting any further help. No, I don't recommend this provider.

THIS IS NOT FRAUDULENT. NOT ACCEPTABLE.
Who has given u the right to hold my funds ? You are not a bank. Just a wallet
I'm complaining to authorities regarding your fraudulent activities.

I'm legally complaining to government authorities in India. I will not let go you guys. Indian government is already against like your fraudulent organisations.

do not use it, it kidnaps the money for 30 days
At first the application was very good, however from one day to the next they decided to close my account with money deposited in the account. The only explanation they gave me was that they wanted to investigate point 11 2 of the terms and conditions of use of the wallet because they do it routinely with any random client. In 30 days I will have the money retained.

I have an account with astropay and was withdrawing money to my mobile wallert when i used the contact options not knowing the money would go to astropay account with that number instead of the mobile money wallet. But whentrying to access the other number account astropay refuses me to access or use the money since the verification fails saying I have a duplicate user. I asked them to return the money to the original account that had sent but they give me a vague response which i cannot use since it requires verification to be completed. when i try to reach out to them again they same that the issue has been responded to and the support close the account.

Never using this platform again, before enaging them word of advise try other working platforms not thieves who are just waiting to lock the account with money in it and not help in returning it.

Hello, Dominic,

Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with us.

We completely understand how this situation may have felt for you, and we‚Äôre here to provide clarity and assistance. At AstroPay, we‚Äôre committed to ensuring both the security of our platform and a smooth user experience for all our customers.

Regarding your recent withdrawal, we‚Äôd like to explain that the "Transfer to a Contact" feature is specifically designed for sending funds to other AstroPay users. For direct withdrawals to a mobile wallet or bank account, the designated withdrawal option within the app is the most effective and accurate method.

When funds are transferred to a contact, the recipient must have an active AstroPay account or create one using the registered number. If registration isn‚Äôt completed within 24 hours, the funds are automatically returned to the sender‚Äôs account, ensuring the funds remain secure.

We understand that accessing the account associated with the transferred funds was challenging due to verification issues. To ensure the safety of our platform, our policies allow only one AstroPay account per individual. These measures are in place to protect user accounts and maintain the security of all transactions.

It‚Äôs important to share that actions like account restrictions or deactivations are guided by our Customer Agreement and Terms of Service, as outlined in Clause 11.3 of our Terms and Conditions. These steps are always taken with the utmost care and only when necessary to uphold the integrity of our platform.

While regulatory requirements prevent us from sharing specific details, we want to reassure you that our primary focus is always on safeguarding user accounts and funds. We appreciate your understanding of the importance of these measures.

On a positive note, we‚Äôre happy to inform you that the funds in question have already been successfully withdrawn. A detailed update will be sent to your registered email address for your reference.

Your feedback is invaluable to us and helps guide improvements to better serve you and all our customers. If there‚Äôs anything further we can assist you with, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Best regards,
AstroPay Support Team

Astropay Is Scam
Recently, I made a review of my ordeal with the Astropay payment transfer for which their support team immediately responded to help resolve my issue as quickly as possible. I captioned my review 'Astropay scam'. After my Trustpilot review I have had three interactions with Astropay through emails. I can now verify my experience with this company with evidence. I can now substantiate my statement of scam with enough inconsistency and irregularities in Astropay's dealings with me.
The genesis of my experience is that I made a withdrawal of $300 from my Deriv Account 20646119 with Ticket 2024763356 on 27th August 2024 to Astropay. This was my first time. I tried severely to withdraw this money from the Astropay platform to my registered MTN mobile money number many times but failed. I used my registered Telecel that also failed. I tried withdrawing with another Deriv trader's number (who is my biological brother) for this same withdrawal attempt and also failed. From August to December was sole frustration and pains to take my money. I could log in to see my wallet with $304 with Astropay but their system would not open to get me verified.
I did verify my identity with different email on 26th December, 2024 and to my shock immediately after the verification the $304 in my account now was $0.0. I made a complain but no response. It is only after making a review on Trustpilot that Astropay sent me emails. Now Astropay saying I made a transfer of $300 from my wallet to the Deriv trader (my brother) on 28th August, that I used his number and that I have violated the company's rule. They want me to reconcile my phone number for the 'transaction' with my brother's number. Now, I just read their claims and wonder what some traders who do not complain go through. Just yesterday I received another message from Astropay saying that my $300 is in my brother's wallet so I should inform him to verify his identity with them so that he can access this money and also they will not communicate with me again on this. Just look at this. From my wallet to my brother's wallet?. My questions to Astropay are these;
1. If I could not withdraw my money before my verification on their system, how could I transfer this same money from the same platform to another person?.
2. if there was any transaction on my account, why would Astropay not send me notification to know the state of my account on the said 28th August transaction?
3. According to the Astropay's letter yesterday, I am to inform my brother to contact them for verification so that he can take the money. What type of business deal is this. Who sent that $300 to Astropay?
4. Why could they not inform me about the state of my account if there was any transaction?
5. Has the Astropay team sat down to check the irregularity and the inconsistency in their messages.
My brother has written to Astropay yesterday and community of traders are watching to see the outcome. I leave this to the readers to draw their own conclusion.

Hello Isaac,

Thank you for your feedback and for letting us know about your withdrawal issues.

We reviewed your case internally and we are glad to provide you with clarity.

1. We observed that you registered more than one AstroPay account, which was against our policy.

2. In trying to initiate a withdrawal from your account, you sent the money TO A CONTACT instead which you claimed to be your brother and the money was credited to the AstroPay account you sent it to.

3. You requested that the money be reversed to your account and were informed by our support team that completed payments cannot be reversed. Only the recipient can withdraw the money or send it back to you.

4. Due to security reasons, we do not discuss account issues with third parties. We ceased communication with you about the issue because you already transferred the money to another AstroPay account and we can only attend to the owner of the account you sent the money to.

5. We assisted the owner of the account in verifying his account and the money has been withdrawn successfully.

We hope this provides you with a better understanding of the situation.

If you have any other concerns or questions, please contact us via live chat or our helpdesk at https://contact.astropay.com/support. We'll be glad to attend to you further.

Best regards,
AstroPay Support Team

Complete scam - can't withdraw
Complete scam. I had to create an Astropay account for a business to pay me out, but i'm not allowed to withdraw it via bank transfer or crypto wallet.
Apparently their team is 'actively working on' enabling withdrawal in Australia, but for months now my money is in limbo with no way to withdraw.

Have not been able to receive bank‚Ä¶
Have not been able to receive bank transfer for 5 days. Am told specialist team are working diligently to correct this issue. 6 times Iv asked how long this has been an issue and they refused to answer. So worried, Iv come to look at reviews and noticed that page 1 is full of good reviews but beyond that are more commonly very bad. So yesterday I had an email saying how much you valued my custom and the issues were because you are streamlining your performance. Only to log in last night and see that you had closed my account completely without forewarning or an explanation. Now you won‚Äôt even reply out of courtesy. Over a month i had an account, in which time I could never use it and now it‚Äôs gone. Absolute shambles please put your money elsewhere guys. Any good reviews on here must be from employees

They responded to the problem but...
They solved the problem.
Thanks to this medium, they contacted me and almost immediately I had the account enabled again.

I have to be honest and say, like I said the bad experience, this was excellent and I am very grateful because the product really interests me and seems good to me.

Thanks to the Astropay support people who solved the problem and thanks to Trustpilot because without this I would still be fighting against chatGPTs that respond automatically.

Best regards.

Cristian.

"

I was able to log into the account again, it is true, but to use the card again it asked me to contact support and that is what I did.

Guess what happened:
Yeah! They blocked the account again saying the same speech about security that they "take very seriously"

It really is unusual! I think they have no support, they are a ChatGPT always repeating the same thing in a loop.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
-----------------------
I am really disappointed with ‚Ä¶
I am really disappointed with the account/application. I was on vacation in Europe, specifically in Paris, when I was trying to transfer funds to use the card and, for no apparent reason, they blocked my account and told me that they would not re-enable it for "security" reasons.

I made several claims to be informed of the reason for the blockage and to indicate the violation; but they do not do so, they always repeat the same answer and do not give a solution. The worst of all is that they tell me to fill out some data so that they can send the case for analysis and they LITERALLY respond to me 5 after minutes saying "then an exhaustive analysis, we have made the decision to permanently block your account..." and so on with each of the complaints I made. It gives the impression that they do not evaluate anything!

I honestly do not know what else to do. I am very interested in having this product, but unfortunately they do not give me a solution. It is unusual because I have accounts in several types of similar applications and capital market brokers and the only one I had problems with was them.

Best customer service iv ever experienced
So i had an issue and emailed their customer service team via email and they responded within 10 mins (not an auto reply), i was shocked how fast it was as they companies take at least 24 hours to reply but not this company.

Problem was solved within a couple messages and you can tell their team are eager to provide the best experience and service possible

Highly recommend them

Hello Subrata,

Thank you for sharing your feedback and bringing the issue with your account to our attention. We understand how this situation must have made you feel.

It is important to note that having more than one account is against AstroPay's policy

Kindly be informed that you are not at liberty to close your active functional account just to be able to create a new one.

We looked into your case and found out that you requested that your account be suspended even though the account is fully functional and attempted to register a new one.

Our users with active accounts cannot choose to abandon their accounts just to create a new one for whatever reason.

We have sent you an email containing a detailed explanation of this topic.

If you have any other concerns or questions, please contact us via live chat or our helpdesk at https://contact.astropay.com/support. We'll be glad to attend to you further.

Best regards,

Great e-wallet
Searching for a e-wallet from some time and found astropay. It's great e wallet as transactions to merchants are done in a whisker. Withdrawal is also fast. Most importantly the customer support responds very quickly. The only con is I am not getting any available options to add money to my wallet from some days.

I see you have a lot of stars
I see you have a lot of stars! But unfortunately, I don't understand an email I received... First, I'll tell you that I don't know how I found out about this app... I probably logged in, like everyone else, to get information and see what the platform is like... The thing is that when you log in, it asks you to validate my identity with "obligation", so I backed out because at that time, I just wanted to see what benefits it had (things I don't argue with, they can be good or bad, I don't know). And a few days ago I received an email telling me to validate my identity because if not, after a certain date, they will charge me 20.-$ monthly until my account balance is reduced to 0. I DON'T UNDERSTAND! I don't even have a balance on this app because I've never logged into that platform, anyway, I don't even know how the site works (?). I think it's a mistake to force someone to validate their account when they're told they'll be charged a fee if they don't, when I've never accessed their platform. Again, at the time I had no intention of rushing to validate my data, maybe I would do it later. But, what happened to me seems like a bad attitude on the part of the site...

Te informamos que los tiempos de aprobaci√≥n pueden variar seg√∫n el m√©todo de pago seleccionado, y son estimados en lugar de ser instant√°neos. Algunas de las razones comunes por las que se pueden presentar retrasos en los pagos incluyen:

No se siguieron correctamente las instrucciones de pago.
El monto pagado no fue el correcto.
El pago se realiz√≥ a trav√©s de una cuenta de terceros.
El pago se efectu√≥ despu√©s de que la orden ya hab√≠a caducado.

Si no recibimos la confirmaci√≥n del pago dentro del plazo especificado, el estado de tu orden de pago caducar√°.

¬°Pero no te preocupes! Para resolver este problema, por favor env√≠anos el comprobante de pago de tu banco o plataforma de pago que incluya todos los detalles de la transacci√≥n. Te hemos enviado un correo electr√≥nico de seguimiento solicitando esta informaci√≥n. Lamentamos sinceramente cualquier inconveniente que esto haya causado.

Agradecemos tu paciencia y comprensi√≥n. Esperamos poder resolver esta situaci√≥n para ti pronto.

Saludos cordiales,
Equipo de Soporte de AstroPay
