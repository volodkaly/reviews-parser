Money Stuck ‚Äì iCashOne (AstroPay India) Blocked My Account
was using iCashOne, the AstroPay app for India, and my account suddenly got blocked without any reason. I had money in my wallet, but since then there has been no response from their support team.

It‚Äôs shocking that a financial app can just lock users out and keep their funds without any explanation or resolution. I have tried multiple times to reach out, but there is zero customer support.

This experience has been very disappointing and unprofessional. If this is how AstroPay operates in India through iCashOne, I strongly advise others to be very cautious before trusting them with your money.

AstroPay keeps blocking my withdrawals with endless reviews
I received money to my AstroPay account on August 08 and since then they keep blocking me every time I try to withdraw. They put my account under ‚Äúreview‚Äù for 7 days, restore it, then block me again when I try to remove my money. This has happened over and over.

This feels like a scam ‚Äì AstroPay is holding my money hostage. Do NOT trust them!

Terrible Experience ‚Äì ‚Çπ1,30,000 Wallet Balance Stuck for Over a Month!
I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with AstroPay. My wallet balance of ‚Çπ1,30,000 has been stuck since June, and despite multiple emails and follow-ups (Ticket ID: 21744189), there has been no clear resolution.

They initially claimed my balance was used to clear a "pending debt" I was never informed about. Later, they said my case is "under analysis" with no timeline or response. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm under severe financial pressure, with EMIs due and bank officials repeatedly calling me.

AstroPay has shown no transparency, accountability, or urgency in resolving this serious issue. This experience has caused me emotional stress and financial hardship. I would strongly advise others to avoid using AstroPay Wallet.

Hello, Abhishek.

Thank you for your feedback and for letting us know about the system migration and the merchant integration.

We understand the situation regarding this migration and the process of accessing your balance.

For the withdrawal from the merchant account to the new application, we recommend reaching out to the merchant‚Äôs support team directly to request an alternative withdrawal method available for users in India.

Rest assured, the team is currently working on improving the wide-range option for the merchant integration with the new system.

Your satisfaction is important to us, and we are taking steps to improve this.

We appreciate your patience and are here to assist you further. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us if you have any more questions or concerns.

Withdrawal Marked ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù but Still‚Ä¶
Withdrawal Marked ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù but Still Not Processed ‚Äî No UTR, No Funds, Just Excuses

Review Body:

I initiated a ‚Çπ30,000 withdrawal from my verified AstroPay wallet on July 19, 2025. The app marked it as ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù, but the amount was never credited to my bank account.

After multiple support tickets, AstroPay has now admitted that the transaction is actually ‚Äúunder review‚Äù ‚Äî meaning it was never processed or sent to my bank despite showing ‚Äúcompleted.‚Äù

They are unable or unwilling to provide a UTR, which would be standard for any NEFT/IMPS payment in India. Their ‚Äúinternal policy‚Äù is simply an excuse to cover for backend delays or unresolved compliance issues.

This is extremely misleading for users and unacceptable for any platform handling financial transactions. I‚Äôve now waited several days with no refund, no credit, and no proof that the money ever left AstroPay‚Äôs system.

If you value transparency, accountability, or timely access to your money ‚Äî AstroPay is not a platform you can rely on. I am preparing to escalate this legally and via the Indian consumer forum if not resolved immediately.

Hello, Satya.

Thank you for sharing your experience with us regarding your withdrawal transaction.

We understand that sometimes withdrawal is shown as approved in the application, but the amount is not yet being credited to your bank account.

There are several factors that may affect your withdrawal not being received in your bank account, including the security checks between the provider and your bank account system to ensure the security of the transaction.

We were able to check your case with our team based on the details shared in your Trustpilot review. We want to assure you that our dedicated support team is actively working on resolving it, and we are giving your case the attention it deserves.

We understand the importance of timely communication, and we will make it a priority to get back to you promptly with an update. You can expect to hear from us via email as soon as possible.

Thank you for your patience, and we look forward to resolving this matter for you.

Best Regards,

Hello, Pavan.

Thank you for sharing your experience with us regarding your pending payment.

Please know that each payment varies based on the method selected, and approval times are estimated rather than instantaneous.

Some of the reasons your payment may not be automatically approved within the processing period are listed below:
- Payment instructions were not followed correctly.

- The payment was made through a third-party account.
- The payment was made after the order had already expired.

We have sent you an email to further explain the situation and what the next step is. Please know that our dedicated support team is actively working on resolving your payment issues, and we will make it a priority.

Support on this app is a joke.
Support on this app is a joke.

My account was suspended some years ago, because i wanted to. Recently i got an email stating about migration. Contacted support and wanted my email and info deleted. Support states i need to provide an id to remove my info and email.

I said theres no rules or laws saying i need to provide id to remove my email from the list.

They getting more stupid and stupid overtime repeated.

I recommend nobody to install and get into this app that has support like school kids in it. :)

Hello, Kristian.

Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

We‚Äôd like to confirm that your account was successfully suspended at your request on April 12, 2023, at 16:05:34 GMT, and has remained suspended since that date.

Regarding the email you received, this is to inform our users that their AstroPay accounts have been migrated to our authorized entity, Larstal Denmark. Specifically for our inactive users, they have to activate their accounts by completing the required information to finalize the migration process before September 1.

As your account has been suspended, you can ignore this email, and there's nothing to worry about.

Should you have more questions, feel free to contact our support agents at support@astropay.com, and we'll be happy to assist you.

Best regards,
AstroPay Support Team

I have 3 pending withdrawals of INR 2000, INR 1500 & INR 1685 that I had requested yesterday. There services used to be good but for the past one year or so they have started giving pathetic services, their customer services takes ages to respond, they have got a CHAT BOT which gives irrelevant canned responses. They deliberately hold on funds and you literally need to write them multiple emails and constantly beg for your own money. I'm really considering to change the payment aggregator now and switch to Skrill or Neteller.

Unfair Account Restriction with No Transparency.
Unfair Account Restriction with No Transparency.

I‚Äôm very disappointed with my experience using AstroPay. My account was permanently blocked without any clear reason or explanation. Despite reaching out multiple times and asking for clarification, I was met with the same generic responses stating that the decision was final, with no specific information on what I supposedly did wrong.
As someone who values transparency and follows platform rules, it‚Äôs frustrating to be treated this way. I was willing to cooperate fully if there were any misunderstandings, but the support team refused to review the case further or provide details.
AstroPay may work well for some, but in my experience, their customer support lacks fairness and transparency, especially when users are left in the dark with no chance to appeal or correct a situation.
I hope they reconsider how they handle such cases moving forward.

Rs 2600 Not Credited to AstroPay Account Despite Successful UPI Payment (UTR 513587619532).
Update: Though AstroPay customer care kept saying that the payment had failed and the amount would be refunded by my bank, my bank clearly informed me that the transaction was successful, and the money was successfully remitted to the merchant. On 27th May, Rs. 2600 was finally added to my AstroPay wallet. Honestly, AstroPay should have at least acknowledged that the payment was successful.

User ID - QaYPxV9A

I am extremely disappointed with the way my issue is being handled.

Made a deposit using UPI of Rs 2600 on May 15, 2025, 8:36 PM, Payment ID 439817342.

Payment Method: Google Pay (UPI)
Merchant Name: BLISSCART BAZAR
UPI ID: blisscart@idfcbank
Transaction Number (UTR) : 513587619532
Issue: Amount not credited to AstroPay account.

The payment was successfully processed and the amount was debited from my bank account. However, the funds have not been added in my AstroPay wallet.

After waiting for some time, I contacted AstroPay Support and shared the payment screenshot. I was advised to wait for 24 hours, after which appropriate assistance would be provided if the issue remained unresolved.

Following the advice, I contacted support again the next day (after more than 24 hours), shared all relevant screenshots again, and also uploaded the required details on the website. Despite these steps, i received no help.

I have contacted your support team multiple times and shared all relevant screenshots. However, instead of resolving the issue, I was told that the transaction failed in their system and that I would receive a refund. This is completely misleading as my bank is saying that Payment was successful and I will not get refund, I need to contact the merchant for refund.

The Merchant has received the money and is not crediting it to my AstroPay account. This raises serious concerns about the integrity of operations of Astropay, and from my point of view, this is starting to look like a scam.

kindly provide me refund or add the amount in my astropay wallet.

20-05-2025 - No Update yet no refund, Customer care is saying that the transaction was failed on their side, Bank is saying money is with the merchant and transaction was successful. Astropay told me to wait till 26th May 2025. Let's see.

Money Stuck ‚Äì iCashOne (AstroPay India) Blocked My Account
was using iCashOne, the AstroPay app for India, and my account suddenly got blocked without any reason. I had money in my wallet, but since then there has been no response from their support team.

It‚Äôs shocking that a financial app can just lock users out and keep their funds without any explanation or resolution. I have tried multiple times to reach out, but there is zero customer support.

This experience has been very disappointing and unprofessional. If this is how AstroPay operates in India through iCashOne, I strongly advise others to be very cautious before trusting them with your money.

AstroPay keeps blocking my withdrawals with endless reviews
I received money to my AstroPay account on August 08 and since then they keep blocking me every time I try to withdraw. They put my account under ‚Äúreview‚Äù for 7 days, restore it, then block me again when I try to remove my money. This has happened over and over.

This feels like a scam ‚Äì AstroPay is holding my money hostage. Do NOT trust them!

Terrible Experience ‚Äì ‚Çπ1,30,000 Wallet Balance Stuck for Over a Month!
I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with AstroPay. My wallet balance of ‚Çπ1,30,000 has been stuck since June, and despite multiple emails and follow-ups (Ticket ID: 21744189), there has been no clear resolution.

They initially claimed my balance was used to clear a "pending debt" I was never informed about. Later, they said my case is "under analysis" with no timeline or response. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm under severe financial pressure, with EMIs due and bank officials repeatedly calling me.

AstroPay has shown no transparency, accountability, or urgency in resolving this serious issue. This experience has caused me emotional stress and financial hardship. I would strongly advise others to avoid using AstroPay Wallet.

Hello, Abhishek.

Thank you for your feedback and for letting us know about the system migration and the merchant integration.

We understand the situation regarding this migration and the process of accessing your balance.

For the withdrawal from the merchant account to the new application, we recommend reaching out to the merchant‚Äôs support team directly to request an alternative withdrawal method available for users in India.

Rest assured, the team is currently working on improving the wide-range option for the merchant integration with the new system.

Your satisfaction is important to us, and we are taking steps to improve this.

We appreciate your patience and are here to assist you further. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us if you have any more questions or concerns.

Withdrawal Marked ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù but Still‚Ä¶
Withdrawal Marked ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù but Still Not Processed ‚Äî No UTR, No Funds, Just Excuses

Review Body:

I initiated a ‚Çπ30,000 withdrawal from my verified AstroPay wallet on July 19, 2025. The app marked it as ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù, but the amount was never credited to my bank account.

After multiple support tickets, AstroPay has now admitted that the transaction is actually ‚Äúunder review‚Äù ‚Äî meaning it was never processed or sent to my bank despite showing ‚Äúcompleted.‚Äù

They are unable or unwilling to provide a UTR, which would be standard for any NEFT/IMPS payment in India. Their ‚Äúinternal policy‚Äù is simply an excuse to cover for backend delays or unresolved compliance issues.

This is extremely misleading for users and unacceptable for any platform handling financial transactions. I‚Äôve now waited several days with no refund, no credit, and no proof that the money ever left AstroPay‚Äôs system.

If you value transparency, accountability, or timely access to your money ‚Äî AstroPay is not a platform you can rely on. I am preparing to escalate this legally and via the Indian consumer forum if not resolved immediately.

Hello, Satya.

Thank you for sharing your experience with us regarding your withdrawal transaction.

We understand that sometimes withdrawal is shown as approved in the application, but the amount is not yet being credited to your bank account.

There are several factors that may affect your withdrawal not being received in your bank account, including the security checks between the provider and your bank account system to ensure the security of the transaction.

We were able to check your case with our team based on the details shared in your Trustpilot review. We want to assure you that our dedicated support team is actively working on resolving it, and we are giving your case the attention it deserves.

We understand the importance of timely communication, and we will make it a priority to get back to you promptly with an update. You can expect to hear from us via email as soon as possible.

Thank you for your patience, and we look forward to resolving this matter for you.

Best Regards,

Hello, Pavan.

Thank you for sharing your experience with us regarding your pending payment.

Please know that each payment varies based on the method selected, and approval times are estimated rather than instantaneous.

Some of the reasons your payment may not be automatically approved within the processing period are listed below:
- Payment instructions were not followed correctly.
- The amount paid was incorrect.
- The payment was made through a third-party account.
- The payment was made after the order had already expired.

We have sent you an email to further explain the situation and what the next step is. Please know that our dedicated support team is actively working on resolving your payment issues, and we will make it a priority.

Don't hesitate to reach out if you require further help or have additional inquiries. We're always ready to help you!

Support on this app is a joke.

My account was suspended some years ago, because i wanted to. Recently i got an email stating about migration. Contacted support and wanted my email and info deleted. Support states i need to provide an id to remove my info and email.

I said theres no rules or laws saying i need to provide id to remove my email from the list.

They getting more stupid and stupid overtime repeated.

I recommend nobody to install and get into this app that has support like school kids in it. :)

Hello, Kristian.

Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

We‚Äôd like to confirm that your account was successfully suspended at your request on April 12, 2023, at 16:05:34 GMT, and has remained suspended since that date.

Regarding the email you received, this is to inform our users that their AstroPay accounts have been migrated to our authorized entity, Larstal Denmark. Specifically for our inactive users, they have to activate their accounts by completing the required information to finalize the migration process before September 1.

As your account has been suspended, you can ignore this email, and there's nothing to worry about.

Should you have more questions, feel free to contact our support agents at support@astropay.com, and we'll be happy to assist you.

Best regards,
AstroPay Support Team

I have 3 pending withdrawals of INR 2000, INR 1500 & INR 1685 that I had requested yesterday. There services used to be good but for the past one year or so they have started giving pathetic services, their customer services takes ages to respond, they have got a CHAT BOT which gives irrelevant canned responses. They deliberately hold on funds and you literally need to write them multiple emails and constantly beg for your own money. I'm really considering to change the payment aggregator now and switch to Skrill or Neteller.

Unfair Account Restriction with No Transparency.
Unfair Account Restriction with No Transparency.

I‚Äôm very disappointed with my experience using AstroPay. My account was permanently blocked without any clear reason or explanation. Despite reaching out multiple times and asking for clarification, I was met with the same generic responses stating that the decision was final, with no specific information on what I supposedly did wrong.
As someone who values transparency and follows platform rules, it‚Äôs frustrating to be treated this way. I was willing to cooperate fully if there were any misunderstandings, but the support team refused to review the case further or provide details.
AstroPay may work well for some, but in my experience, their customer support lacks fairness and transparency, especially when users are left in the dark with no chance to appeal or correct a situation.
I hope they reconsider how they handle such cases moving forward.

Rs 2600 Not Credited to AstroPay Account Despite Successful UPI Payment (UTR 513587619532).
Update: Though AstroPay customer care kept saying that the payment had failed and the amount would be refunded by my bank, my bank clearly informed me that the transaction was successful, and the money was successfully remitted to the merchant. On 27th May, Rs. 2600 was finally added to my AstroPay wallet. Honestly, AstroPay should have at least acknowledged that the payment was successful.

User ID - QaYPxV9A

I am extremely disappointed with the way my issue is being handled.

Made a deposit using UPI of Rs 2600 on May 15, 2025, 8:36 PM, Payment ID 439817342.

Payment Method: Google Pay (UPI)
Merchant Name: BLISSCART BAZAR
UPI ID: blisscart@idfcbank
Transaction Number (UTR) : 513587619532
Issue: Amount not credited to AstroPay account.

The payment was successfully processed and the amount was debited from my bank account. However, the funds have not been added in my AstroPay wallet.

After waiting for some time, I contacted AstroPay Support and shared the payment screenshot. I was advised to wait for 24 hours, after which appropriate assistance would be provided if the issue remained unresolved.

Following the advice, I contacted support again the next day (after more than 24 hours), shared all relevant screenshots again, and also uploaded the required details on the website. Despite these steps, i received no help.

I have contacted your support team multiple times and shared all relevant screenshots. However, instead of resolving the issue, I was told that the transaction failed in their system and that I would receive a refund. This is completely misleading as my bank is saying that Payment was successful and I will not get refund, I need to contact the merchant for refund.

The Merchant has received the money and is not crediting it to my AstroPay account. This raises serious concerns about the integrity of operations of Astropay, and from my point of view, this is starting to look like a scam.

kindly provide me refund or add the amount in my astropay wallet.

20-05-2025 - No Update yet no refund, Customer care is saying that the transaction was failed on their side, Bank is saying money is with the merchant and transaction was successful. Astropay told me to wait till 26th May 2025. Let's see.

Money Stuck ‚Äì iCashOne (AstroPay India) Blocked My Account
was using iCashOne, the AstroPay app for India, and my account suddenly got blocked without any reason. I had money in my wallet, but since then there has been no response from their support team.

It‚Äôs shocking that a financial app can just lock users out and keep their funds without any explanation or resolution. I have tried multiple times to reach out, but there is zero customer support.

This experience has been very disappointing and unprofessional. If this is how AstroPay operates in India through iCashOne, I strongly advise others to be very cautious before trusting them with your money.

AstroPay keeps blocking my withdrawals with endless reviews
I received money to my AstroPay account on August 08 and since then they keep blocking me every time I try to withdraw. They put my account under ‚Äúreview‚Äù for 7 days, restore it, then block me again when I try to remove my money. This has happened over and over.

This feels like a scam ‚Äì AstroPay is holding my money hostage. Do NOT trust them!

Terrible Experience ‚Äì ‚Çπ1,30,000 Wallet Balance Stuck for Over a Month!
I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with AstroPay. My wallet balance of ‚Çπ1,30,000 has been stuck since June, and despite multiple emails and follow-ups (Ticket ID: 21744189), there has been no clear resolution.

They initially claimed my balance was used to clear a "pending debt" I was never informed about. Later, they said my case is "under analysis" with no timeline or response. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm under severe financial pressure, with EMIs due and bank officials repeatedly calling me.

AstroPay has shown no transparency, accountability, or urgency in resolving this serious issue. This experience has caused me emotional stress and financial hardship. I would strongly advise others to avoid using AstroPay Wallet.

Hello, Abhishek.

Thank you for your feedback and for letting us know about the system migration and the merchant integration.

We understand the situation regarding this migration and the process of accessing your balance.

For the withdrawal from the merchant account to the new application, we recommend reaching out to the merchant‚Äôs support team directly to request an alternative withdrawal method available for users in India.

Rest assured, the team is currently working on improving the wide-range option for the merchant integration with the new system.

Your satisfaction is important to us, and we are taking steps to improve this.

We appreciate your patience and are here to assist you further. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us if you have any more questions or concerns.

Withdrawal Marked ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù but Still‚Ä¶
Withdrawal Marked ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù but Still Not Processed ‚Äî No UTR, No Funds, Just Excuses

Review Body:

I initiated a ‚Çπ30,000 withdrawal from my verified AstroPay wallet on July 19, 2025. The app marked it as ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù, but the amount was never credited to my bank account.

After multiple support tickets, AstroPay has now admitted that the transaction is actually ‚Äúunder review‚Äù ‚Äî meaning it was never processed or sent to my bank despite showing ‚Äúcompleted.‚Äù

They are unable or unwilling to provide a UTR, which would be standard for any NEFT/IMPS payment in India. Their ‚Äúinternal policy‚Äù is simply an excuse to cover for backend delays or unresolved compliance issues.

This is extremely misleading for users and unacceptable for any platform handling financial transactions. I‚Äôve now waited several days with no refund, no credit, and no proof that the money ever left AstroPay‚Äôs system.

If you value transparency, accountability, or timely access to your money ‚Äî AstroPay is not a platform you can rely on. I am preparing to escalate this legally and via the Indian consumer forum if not resolved immediately.

Hello, Satya.

Thank you for sharing your experience with us regarding your withdrawal transaction.

We understand that sometimes withdrawal is shown as approved in the application, but the amount is not yet being credited to your bank account.

There are several factors that may affect your withdrawal not being received in your bank account, including the security checks between the provider and your bank account system to ensure the security of the transaction.

We were able to check your case with our team based on the details shared in your Trustpilot review. We want to assure you that our dedicated support team is actively working on resolving it, and we are giving your case the attention it deserves.

We understand the importance of timely communication, and we will make it a priority to get back to you promptly with an update. You can expect to hear from us via email as soon as possible.

Thank you for your patience, and we look forward to resolving this matter for you.

Best Regards,

Hello, Pavan.

Thank you for sharing your experience with us regarding your pending payment.

Please know that each payment varies based on the method selected, and approval times are estimated rather than instantaneous.

Some of the reasons your payment may not be automatically approved within the processing period are listed below:
- Payment instructions were not followed correctly.
- The amount paid was incorrect.
- The payment was made through a third-party account.
- The payment was made after the order had already expired.

We have sent you an email to further explain the situation and what the next step is. Please know that our dedicated support team is actively working on resolving your payment issues, and we will make it a priority.

Don't hesitate to reach out if you require further help or have additional inquiries. We're always ready to help you!

Support on this app is a joke.

My account was suspended some years ago, because i wanted to. Recently i got an email stating about migration. Contacted support and wanted my email and info deleted. Support states i need to provide an id to remove my info and email.

I said theres no rules or laws saying i need to provide id to remove my email from the list.

They getting more stupid and stupid overtime repeated.

I recommend nobody to install and get into this app that has support like school kids in it. :)

Hello, Kristian.

Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

We‚Äôd like to confirm that your account was successfully suspended at your request on April 12, 2023, at 16:05:34 GMT, and has remained suspended since that date.

Regarding the email you received, this is to inform our users that their AstroPay accounts have been migrated to our authorized entity, Larstal Denmark. Specifically for our inactive users, they have to activate their accounts by completing the required information to finalize the migration process before September 1.

As your account has been suspended, you can ignore this email, and there's nothing to worry about.

Should you have more questions, feel free to contact our support agents at support@astropay.com, and we'll be happy to assist you.

Best regards,
AstroPay Support Team

I have 3 pending withdrawals of INR 2000, INR 1500 & INR 1685 that I had requested yesterday. There services used to be good but for the past one year or so they have started giving pathetic services, their customer services takes ages to respond, they have got a CHAT BOT which gives irrelevant canned responses. They deliberately hold on funds and you literally need to write them multiple emails and constantly beg for your own money. I'm really considering to change the payment aggregator now and switch to Skrill or Neteller.

Unfair Account Restriction with No Transparency.
Unfair Account Restriction with No Transparency.

I‚Äôm very disappointed with my experience using AstroPay. My account was permanently blocked without any clear reason or explanation. Despite reaching out multiple times and asking for clarification, I was met with the same generic responses stating that the decision was final, with no specific information on what I supposedly did wrong.
As someone who values transparency and follows platform rules, it‚Äôs frustrating to be treated this way. I was willing to cooperate fully if there were any misunderstandings, but the support team refused to review the case further or provide details.
AstroPay may work well for some, but in my experience, their customer support lacks fairness and transparency, especially when users are left in the dark with no chance to appeal or correct a situation.
I hope they reconsider how they handle such cases moving forward.

Rs 2600 Not Credited to AstroPay Account Despite Successful UPI Payment (UTR 513587619532).
Update: Though AstroPay customer care kept saying that the payment had failed and the amount would be refunded by my bank, my bank clearly informed me that the transaction was successful, and the money was successfully remitted to the merchant. On 27th May, Rs. 2600 was finally added to my AstroPay wallet. Honestly, AstroPay should have at least acknowledged that the payment was successful.

User ID - QaYPxV9A

I am extremely disappointed with the way my issue is being handled.

Made a deposit using UPI of Rs 2600 on May 15, 2025, 8:36 PM, Payment ID 439817342.

Payment Method: Google Pay (UPI)
Merchant Name: BLISSCART BAZAR
UPI ID: blisscart@idfcbank
Transaction Number (UTR) : 513587619532
Issue: Amount not credited to AstroPay account.

The payment was successfully processed and the amount was debited from my bank account. However, the funds have not been added in my AstroPay wallet.

After waiting for some time, I contacted AstroPay Support and shared the payment screenshot. I was advised to wait for 24 hours, after which appropriate assistance would be provided if the issue remained unresolved.

Following the advice, I contacted support again the next day (after more than 24 hours), shared all relevant screenshots again, and also uploaded the required details on the website. Despite these steps, i received no help.

I have contacted your support team multiple times and shared all relevant screenshots. However, instead of resolving the issue, I was told that the transaction failed in their system and that I would receive a refund. This is completely misleading as my bank is saying that Payment was successful and I will not get refund, I need to contact the merchant for refund.

The Merchant has received the money and is not crediting it to my AstroPay account. This raises serious concerns about the integrity of operations of Astropay, and from my point of view, this is starting to look like a scam.

kindly provide me refund or add the amount in my astropay wallet.

20-05-2025 - No Update yet no refund, Customer care is saying that the transaction was failed on their side, Bank is saying money is with the merchant and transaction was successful. Astropay told me to wait till 26th May 2025. Let's see.

Money Stuck ‚Äì iCashOne (AstroPay India) Blocked My Account
was using iCashOne, the AstroPay app for India, and my account suddenly got blocked without any reason. I had money in my wallet, but since then there has been no response from their support team.

It‚Äôs shocking that a financial app can just lock users out and keep their funds without any explanation or resolution. I have tried multiple times to reach out, but there is zero customer support.

This experience has been very disappointing and unprofessional. If this is how AstroPay operates in India through iCashOne, I strongly advise others to be very cautious before trusting them with your money.

AstroPay keeps blocking my withdrawals with endless reviews
I received money to my AstroPay account on August 08 and since then they keep blocking me every time I try to withdraw. They put my account under ‚Äúreview‚Äù for 7 days, restore it, then block me again when I try to remove my money. This has happened over and over.

This feels like a scam ‚Äì AstroPay is holding my money hostage. Do NOT trust them!

Terrible Experience ‚Äì ‚Çπ1,30,000 Wallet Balance Stuck for Over a Month!
I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with AstroPay. My wallet balance of ‚Çπ1,30,000 has been stuck since June, and despite multiple emails and follow-ups (Ticket ID: 21744189), there has been no clear resolution.

They initially claimed my balance was used to clear a "pending debt" I was never informed about. Later, they said my case is "under analysis" with no timeline or response. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm under severe financial pressure, with EMIs due and bank officials repeatedly calling me.

AstroPay has shown no transparency, accountability, or urgency in resolving this serious issue. This experience has caused me emotional stress and financial hardship. I would strongly advise others to avoid using AstroPay Wallet.

Hello, Abhishek.

Thank you for your feedback and for letting us know about the system migration and the merchant integration.

We understand the situation regarding this migration and the process of accessing your balance.

For the withdrawal from the merchant account to the new application, we recommend reaching out to the merchant‚Äôs support team directly to request an alternative withdrawal method available for users in India.

Rest assured, the team is currently working on improving the wide-range option for the merchant integration with the new system.

Your satisfaction is important to us, and we are taking steps to improve this.

We appreciate your patience and are here to assist you further. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us if you have any more questions or concerns.

Withdrawal Marked ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù but Still‚Ä¶
Withdrawal Marked ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù but Still Not Processed ‚Äî No UTR, No Funds, Just Excuses

Review Body:

I initiated a ‚Çπ30,000 withdrawal from my verified AstroPay wallet on July 19, 2025. The app marked it as ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù, but the amount was never credited to my bank account.

After multiple support tickets, AstroPay has now admitted that the transaction is actually ‚Äúunder review‚Äù ‚Äî meaning it was never processed or sent to my bank despite showing ‚Äúcompleted.‚Äù

They are unable or unwilling to provide a UTR, which would be standard for any NEFT/IMPS payment in India. Their ‚Äúinternal policy‚Äù is simply an excuse to cover for backend delays or unresolved compliance issues.

This is extremely misleading for users and unacceptable for any platform handling financial transactions. I‚Äôve now waited several days with no refund, no credit, and no proof that the money ever left AstroPay‚Äôs system.

If you value transparency, accountability, or timely access to your money ‚Äî AstroPay is not a platform you can rely on. I am preparing to escalate this legally and via the Indian consumer forum if not resolved immediately.

Hello, Satya.

Thank you for sharing your experience with us regarding your withdrawal transaction.

We understand that sometimes withdrawal is shown as approved in the application, but the amount is not yet being credited to your bank account.

There are several factors that may affect your withdrawal not being received in your bank account, including the security checks between the provider and your bank account system to ensure the security of the transaction.

We were able to check your case with our team based on the details shared in your Trustpilot review. We want to assure you that our dedicated support team is actively working on resolving it, and we are giving your case the attention it deserves.

We understand the importance of timely communication, and we will make it a priority to get back to you promptly with an update. You can expect to hear from us via email as soon as possible.

Thank you for your patience, and we look forward to resolving this matter for you.

Best Regards,
AstroPay Support Team

Hello, Pavan.

Thank you for sharing your experience with us regarding your pending payment.

Please know that each payment varies based on the method selected, and approval times are estimated rather than instantaneous.

Some of the reasons your payment may not be automatically approved within the processing period are listed below:
- Payment instructions were not followed correctly.
- The amount paid was incorrect.
- The payment was made through a third-party account.
- The payment was made after the order had already expired.

We have sent you an email to further explain the situation and what the next step is. Please know that our dedicated support team is actively working on resolving your payment issues, and we will make it a priority.

Don't hesitate to reach out if you require further help or have additional inquiries. We're always ready to help you!

Support on this app is a joke.

My account was suspended some years ago, because i wanted to. Recently i got an email stating about migration. Contacted support and wanted my email and info deleted. Support states i need to provide an id to remove my info and email.

I said theres no rules or laws saying i need to provide id to remove my email from the list.

They getting more stupid and stupid overtime repeated.

I recommend nobody to install and get into this app that has support like school kids in it. :)

Hello, Kristian.

Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

We‚Äôd like to confirm that your account was successfully suspended at your request on April 12, 2023, at 16:05:34 GMT, and has remained suspended since that date.

Regarding the email you received, this is to inform our users that their AstroPay accounts have been migrated to our authorized entity, Larstal Denmark. Specifically for our inactive users, they have to activate their accounts by completing the required information to finalize the migration process before September 1.

As your account has been suspended, you can ignore this email, and there's nothing to worry about.

Should you have more questions, feel free to contact our support agents at support@astropay.com, and we'll be happy to assist you.

Best regards,
AstroPay Support Team

I have 3 pending withdrawals of INR‚Ä¶
I have 3 pending withdrawals of INR 2000, INR 1500 & INR 1685 that I had requested yesterday. There services used to be good but for the past one year or so they have started giving pathetic services, their customer services takes ages to respond, they have got a CHAT BOT which gives irrelevant canned responses. They deliberately hold on funds and you literally need to write them multiple emails and constantly beg for your own money. I'm really considering to change the payment aggregator now and switch to Skrill or Neteller.

Unfair Account Restriction with No Transparency.
Unfair Account Restriction with No Transparency.

I‚Äôm very disappointed with my experience using AstroPay. My account was permanently blocked without any clear reason or explanation. Despite reaching out multiple times and asking for clarification, I was met with the same generic responses stating that the decision was final, with no specific information on what I supposedly did wrong.
As someone who values transparency and follows platform rules, it‚Äôs frustrating to be treated this way. I was willing to cooperate fully if there were any misunderstandings, but the support team refused to review the case further or provide details.
AstroPay may work well for some, but in my experience, their customer support lacks fairness and transparency, especially when users are left in the dark with no chance to appeal or correct a situation.
I hope they reconsider how they handle such cases moving forward.

Rs 2600 Not Credited to AstroPay Account Despite Successful UPI Payment (UTR 513587619532).
Update: Though AstroPay customer care kept saying that the payment had failed and the amount would be refunded by my bank, my bank clearly informed me that the transaction was successful, and the money was successfully remitted to the merchant. On 27th May, Rs. 2600 was finally added to my AstroPay wallet. Honestly, AstroPay should have at least acknowledged that the payment was successful.

User ID - QaYPxV9A

I am extremely disappointed with the way my issue is being handled.

Made a deposit using UPI of Rs 2600 on May 15, 2025, 8:36 PM, Payment ID 439817342.

Payment Method: Google Pay (UPI)
Merchant Name: BLISSCART BAZAR
UPI ID: blisscart@idfcbank
Transaction Number (UTR) : 513587619532
Issue: Amount not credited to AstroPay account.

The payment was successfully processed and the amount was debited from my bank account. However, the funds have not been added in my AstroPay wallet.

After waiting for some time, I contacted AstroPay Support and shared the payment screenshot. I was advised to wait for 24 hours, after which appropriate assistance would be provided if the issue remained unresolved.

Following the advice, I contacted support again the next day (after more than 24 hours), shared all relevant screenshots again, and also uploaded the required details on the website. Despite these steps, i received no help.

I have contacted your support team multiple times and shared all relevant screenshots. However, instead of resolving the issue, I was told that the transaction failed in their system and that I would receive a refund. This is completely misleading as my bank is saying that Payment was successful and I will not get refund, I need to contact the merchant for refund.

The Merchant has received the money and is not crediting it to my AstroPay account. This raises serious concerns about the integrity of operations of Astropay, and from my point of view, this is starting to look like a scam.

kindly provide me refund or add the amount in my astropay wallet.

20-05-2025 - No Update yet no refund, Customer care is saying that the transaction was failed on their side, Bank is saying money is with the merchant and transaction was successful. Astropay told me to wait till 26th May 2025. Let's see.
