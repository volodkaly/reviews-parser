I had a very positive experience with this casino until yesterday, January 24, 2025. I've tried for 24 hours to log in, and it takes me to a page that says, 'we're under scheduled maintenance.' Is anyone else having the same problem?

My Bitspin365 experience
The experience was great for my first time I didn't have to deposit. I got my payout within 15 minutes. Operators are very helpful. I only wish they had sports betting. Maybe one day they will. Bitspin365 is awesome 👌

Hello there,

Thank you for your review. We’re not sure about the specifics of your situation as we don't have enough details to locate your account. Please provide your account information so we can look into this matter properly.

Once we have that, we can determine what went wrong and why you haven't received your welcome bonus as expected. If there is any issue on our side, rest assured we’ll address it promptly.

We look forward to your reply.

A Little Caveat
I have always sung the praises of this casino, and will continue to do so because they have one of nicest customer services teams of any organization I have ever encountered. THEY ROCK!

This customer service team is fast, personable, relatable, efficient and seem to be good people all the way around. Heck, even in every instance where I have reached out to them for a request and was denied, they are always pleasant and NEVER message me with one of those HORRIBLE pre-written "It breaks my heart blah blah blah..." or "It just saddens me yadda yadda yadda..." like many other casinos. Or worse yet, they never deny you of your request AND THEN retort with "If you make a deposit of yackity schmackity lackity..." like the majority of their competitors. They simply make the gaming experience better, which puts this casino above the rest.

WITH. THAT. SAID ...

... someone needs to pull Victoria aside and have a little chit chat with her about where she works and how she needs to get on board with the rest of the employees. I'm not going to let the few interactions I have had with her yesterday spoil my view about this casino, thus the reason I still gave this casino five star, but seriously- one bad apple spoils the barrel.

Perhaps she could shadow one of her colleagues like Hannah (a.k.a BESTIE), Michael, Benjamin, Alice, Adam, Antony, Ario, Samuel or anyone else who is a rockstar in their customer service department. And if that doesn't help to improve Victoria's skill, perhaps she should be promoted back to customer.

My Bitspin365 experience
The experience was great for my first time I didn't have to deposit. I got my payout within 15 minutes. Operators are very helpful. I only wish they had sports betting. Maybe one day they will. Bitspin365 is awesome 👌

One of the best, if not the best
This is a very straightforward casino, the website is easy to find your way around, so many awesome bonuses. I've cashed out 2x and both were under 1 hr!! The best thing, however, is their chat support. They go above duty!

Hello there,

Thank you for your review. We’re not sure about the specifics of your situation as we don't have enough details to locate your account. Please provide your account information so we can look into this matter properly.

Once we have that, we can determine what went wrong and why you haven't received your welcome bonus as expected. If there is any issue on our side, rest assured we’ll address it promptly.

We look forward to your reply.

A Little Caveat
I have always sung the praises of this casino, and will continue to do so because they have one of nicest customer services teams of any organization I have ever encountered. THEY ROCK!

This customer service team is fast, personable, relatable, efficient and seem to be good people all the way around. Heck, even in every instance where I have reached out to them for a request and was denied, they are always pleasant and NEVER message me with one of those HORRIBLE pre-written "It breaks my heart blah blah blah..." or "It just saddens me yadda yadda yadda..." like many other casinos. Or worse yet, they never deny you of your request AND THEN retort with "If you make a deposit of yackity schmackity lackity..." like the majority of their competitors. They simply make the gaming experience better, which puts this casino above the rest.

WITH. THAT. SAID ...

... someone needs to pull Victoria aside and have a little chit chat with her about where she works and how she needs to get on board with the rest of the employees. I'm not going to let the few interactions I have had with her yesterday spoil my view about this casino, thus the reason I still gave this casino five star, but seriously- one bad apple spoils the barrel.

Perhaps she could shadow one of her colleagues like Hannah (a.k.a BESTIE), Michael, Benjamin, Alice, Adam, Antony, Ario, Samuel or anyone else who is a rockstar in their customer service department. And if that doesn't help to improve Victoria's skill, perhaps she should be promoted back to customer.

Excellent
Excellent! I mean the most important part of online casino is the cashout, and betspin365 is instant cashout. Account verification took 1 day and after that u can cashout instantly. Great promos, just make sure u read and understand the guidelines. Other casinos, some say cashout in 3 days, ends up being 5. Others are a week, some 2 weeks. Who wants that?

Hello there,

Thank you for sharing your thoughts. We’re not entirely sure what you’re referring to, but let us clarify how our bonuses work and try to assist.

If you’ve claimed a free bonus without making a deposit, you can still cash out winnings up to the maximum limit set for the promotion. However, this is clearly outlined in the bonus terms before you begin playing.

If you’re looking to withdraw larger amounts, you’d need to make a clean deposit instead of using a free bonus. Deposited funds don’t come with withdrawal limits, ensuring a seamless experience for our players.

We encourage all players to review the terms of any promotion before participating. If you have further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out - we’re always happy to help.

Hi,

Thank you for sharing your thoughts! I’m sorry to hear you feel that way. We actually pride ourselves on offering one of the strongest welcome packages in the industry, along with four unique deposit bonuses available every single day. It sounds like there might have been some misunderstanding, and I’d love to make it right.

If you’re open to it, I’d be happy to create a custom deposit bonus just for you. Feel free to reach out directly, and let’s get something exciting lined up!

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

Well I only joined today. When I read reviews here they seem fake. In fact 2 are almost identical. The company also has not claimed it here. That being said every person below was telling the truth about customer service. For one they are real people not AI don't get me started on that subject. Bonus came I've had no ads and it does not say but coins every time I do something. One person said you win on bonus here and I did as I have every casino I go to it's when the bonus is over that I can't win anything. I won 3000 tonight I've played through 2000 of 4009 so 2 grand to go before I'll have an answer in the cash out. One thing does irritate me
You can only withdraw 20 dollars max of the bonus winnings you the lose what every left after withdraw I finally win somewhere and I can't have it lol. All all I love it so far. Will post an update

Hello William,

Thank you for joining us at Casino BitSpin365! We’re thrilled to have you onboard and look forward to a great journey together.

We also appreciate the time you took to read through our reviews. We’re proud of the feedback we’ve received and value the trust our players place in us.

Regarding the promotion you claimed, it’s important to note that this was a free welcome bonus, which comes with a maximum cashout limit of $20. These terms are clearly outlined before a player claims the bonus to ensure full transparency.

As per the rules, once you reach the maximum cashout limit of $20, any excess balance - whether it’s $50 or $5,000 - will need to be removed. This policy applies specifically to winnings from free promotions. If you had played with a deposit instead, there wouldn’t be any withdrawal limits.

If you have further questions or need assistance with anything else, please don’t hesitate to contact us directly.

One of the best(if not the best) rival casinos
I couldn't believe that a casino that uses the rival provider is so perfect, the kyc didn't take long and the withdrawal was very fast, nothing to complain about and they also let you withdraw a lot of money from the no deposit bonus after confirming with your own money, it's not a 5 because no casino is perfect in the world

Best Customer service experience
Customer service Antony was by far the best and most helpful agent to help me with my verification process. Was really informative and helped resolve my issue with my verification process.
