DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

Dubious Casino
I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!

I won 5K (without bonus). Verification took several days.
Casino accepts deposits via Visa, Master, Bitcoin and Tether.
Terms and conditions state that withdrawal should be via deposit method.

I deposited with Visa and Master - when I tried to withdraw, only Master and Bitcoin were available - both at a limit of 400 EUR per day (and not at 2000 EUR per day as stated in their terms and conditions).

Visa-withdrawal wasn´t available, so I tried to withdraw via Mastercard (according to terms and conditions) - I waited 2 days until withdrawal changed form "pending" to "approved". At the 3rd day I had the message "the request was canceled for technical reasons. Try to create the request again".

The first time I really thought, it was just a glitch - and I tried to withdraw 400 again ... and again ... all attempts were rejected, all showed the message above.

I contacted casino via chat - they told me that there are technical issues paying to the Mastercard - and I should use Bitcoin.

I don´t have Bitcoin, I don´t have a clue about Bitcoin, I don´t have time to learn about Bitcoin. If I wanted to use Bitcoin, I would have used a Bitcoin-casino.

Also, casino has a DMCAprotected Icon on the site - but DMCA has not protected nor scanned the site.

If I receive my money from this casino I will amend this review accordingly.

DISGRACEFUL.
Wouldn’t even rate it one star but had to choose at least one star! Won money withdrew it, got approved and then they cancelled it last minute. Nothing but a con site so if you don’t want to loose your money and receive nothing back I would suggest DO NOT play this con of a site.

If u tell them u have a gambling…
If u tell them u have a gambling problem they close it then re open it every month. They still call me too with bonus offers. This has gone on for over a year. Very irresponsible when someone is telling them their gambling is out of control and they reply we can't close it down permanent. Only for a month.. Disgrace!!!!!!
